                 Laurel Schwulst discusses the importance of individual online presence in creative design as the website is an individual act of common aspiration. The essay revolves around the idea of the necessity of personal websites for interaction among artists as she highlights the corporation of individuals for the potential web’s future and its vitality in a vast network. She explains the possibility and diversity in the forms of websites that are virtually limitless, and how the creator simultaneously takes on the role of author and architect. As creators apply visual elements to the website, it, in turn, contributes to the creation and development of their own identity. To that degree, the virtual space for personal ideas where people can experiment with new mediums and ways of making a digital landscape is more meaningful and crucial than the majority of websites designed for commercial purposes or business opportunities. Whether people choose to make that a personal project or something that’s accessible to the public, is a decision that comes later on in the process. 
                 <br>
                I agree with how Schwulst defines world-building, which she associates inside the world with the surrounding world, such as language, style, rules, and architecture. Artists create their own work in their world for either themselves or others, which becomes an intersection with those people through sharing the virtual space. The significance of the website can be interconnected to how it works strategically in parallel to other activities of the artist. The use of metaphor in the essay is the most impressive aspect of the website. Schwulst compares a website to mundane objects and things, then explains how those objects are similar to websites. She uses metaphors for the form of individual websites by associating with naturalistic elements (a room, shelf, plant, etc.) She deliberately appeals to the artists to be more receptive to creating their own websites due to their positive aspects such as endless potential and uniqueness in various uses and ephemeral nature. For instance, she describes the “website as room” which induces audience, especially the artists by saying, “a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on the occasion.”

            The article discusses a technical chronology of digital typography from 1984 to 1997 which the early technical advancements affected the innovations of graphic designs including typography and cyberspace. Throughout the reading, I could see that Staples underscores the importance of technology in design and its association with words and images in cyberspace through computer-modeled and algorithmically-driven typography. As the spatial opportunities of cyberspace increase with the development of digital tools, the formal and stylistic possibilities of expanding through depictions of letterforms. Indeed, digital tools are pivotal for designers who create words, images, and spaces on the screen or paper as Macintosh computers, and software like Adobe Systems chronologically contributed to the exploration and production of various experimental designs. From the technical chronology of digital typography, I found Macintosh Operating System intriguing in terms of the concentration on the text’s appearance. According to the article, “the system includes the ability to choose among multiple typefaces and font families that could be installed in the Macintosh system file.” Moreover, there are “standard options for rendering type as “plain text, bold, italic, underlined, outlined and shadowed in a range of sizes.” These settings show how people started to consider typographic designs in the earlier stage of the digital world and the significance of visual elements in words. Following the digital construction of letterforms, such as Lucida successfully satisfied the “multiple demands of page and screen through a comprehensive set of fonts suitable for printing and screen display.” Therefore, I realized that digital typography gradually becomes visually, conceptually, and purposefully powerful as the potential of diversity in typographic design extends with technological advancement.

        <h3><span class="title">Pascal Glissmann</span></h3>

            The web is all about an “explicit act of will” - an individual’s choice to change their behaviors about what to use, where to work, what to adopt, and what to pay attention to. Frank Chimero who is a brand and product designer currently in New York shares his perspective on the design principles and visual elements of the web in regard to technological influences. I assume that one of the pivotal messages in the article which Chimero wants to convey is “no metaphors or analogies are needed for insight, only the willingness to listen to the subject speak for itself, even if it contradicts received wisdom.” This does not only apply to the design facets but also provides life lessons in various realms which underscore the importance of listening to others and embracing different points of view. 
            <br>
            In the article, Chimero discusses the “vertical bias” in web design which “vertical stacks are much easier to adapt across all kinds of screen sizes, because you don’t have layout issues to manage with more or less space across.” I could learn the visual effects of the web design method which accompanies the consistency of design. Indeed, the consistencies establish best practices as they are proof of design patterns. 
            <br>
            Furthermore, Chimero restated the web design as “an edgeless surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment.” The agelessness is comprised of “individual pages linked together, so its structure can branch out forever” in the web’s structure. Chimero highlights its crucial importance on the screens that show the web which “offers an infinite canvas that can scroll in any direction for however long” and “speaks to the diffusion of device and viewport sizes.” When I view the screens of the web that are naturally connected as they are single scenes, I can sense the blurred lines between the disciplines that work together to convey both visual and contextual information. The agelessness successfully and effectively designs the screens for the web with clarity of expression and communication. 
            <br>
            For me, it was easier to understand the idea of agelessness and structure of the web by depicting David Hokney’s project with Polaroids that are tiled together using redundancy in image-making practice. The way he abandoned the notion of two-dimensional works of art being fixed in rectangular size leads to the expression of small individual photos being overlaid and assembled which relates to the edgeless nature of web structure discussed in the article.
