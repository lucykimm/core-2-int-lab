                <h2>Lecture 1</h2>
                <h3><span class="title">Elaine Lopez</span></h3>
                 <p>
                 Laurel Schwulst discusses the importance of individual online presence in creative design as the website is an individual act of common aspiration. The essay revolves around the idea of the necessity of personal websites for interaction among artists as she highlights the corporation of individuals for the potential web’s future and its vitality in a vast network. She explains the possibility and diversity in the forms of websites that are virtually limitless, and how the creator simultaneously takes on the role of author and architect. As creators apply visual elements to the website, it, in turn, contributes to the creation and development of their own identity. To that degree, the virtual space for personal ideas where people can experiment with new mediums and ways of making a digital landscape is more meaningful and crucial than the majority of websites designed for commercial purposes or business opportunities. Whether people choose to make that a personal project or something that’s accessible to the public, is a decision that comes later on in the process. 
                 <br>
                I agree with how Schwulst defines world-building, which she associates inside the world with the surrounding world, such as language, style, rules, and architecture. Artists create their own work in their world for either themselves or others, which becomes an intersection with those people through sharing the virtual space. The significance of the website can be interconnected to how it works strategically in parallel to other activities of the artist. The use of metaphor in the essay is the most impressive aspect of the website. Schwulst compares a website to mundane objects and things, then explains how those objects are similar to websites. She uses metaphors for the form of individual websites by associating with naturalistic elements (a room, shelf, plant, etc.) She deliberately appeals to the artists to be more receptive to creating their own websites due to their positive aspects such as endless potential and uniqueness in various uses and ephemeral nature. For instance, she describes the “website as room” which induces audience, especially the artists by saying, “a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on the occasion.”

        <h2>Lecture 2</h2>
        <h3><span class="title">Lynn Kiang</span></h3>
        <p>
            The lecture on decolonization by Elaine is a thought-provoking discussion on the challenges facing the design industry. She emphasizes that decolonization should not be a mere metaphor for the changes required in the industry, but rather an active process of embracing diverse cultures and ideas. She poses a compelling question about how to remove certain aspects of design without alienating individuals in the process. Elaine's work focuses on the intersection of culture, identity, equity, and risograph printing. 
            <br>
            Through her projects, she aims to share stories that have long been neglected. This lecture shed light on the challenges facing the design industry in embracing diverse cultures and identities. Her work is a testament to the potential of design to explore and celebrate cultures, and her call to action to colonize design by incorporating diverse cultures and ideas is crucial in expanding the field of design.

        <h2>Lecture 3</h2>
        <h3><span class="title">Pascal Glissmann</span></h3>
        <p>
            The lecture discusses the design strategy, concept, and development of the multi-disciplinary design studio, Dome with the co-founder Lynn Kiang. She introduces some environmental design projects and how they are conceptualized by designers and produced throughout the concept design process. 
            <br>
            The project “Seat at the Table'' from Dome provides an insightful understanding of the interplay between environmental design and social issues, specifically women’s suffrage, and promotes gender equity in leadership. The exhibit uses various methods, such as interactive touchscreens, infographic furniture, environmental statistics, and printed brochures to highlight the current status of women. Lynn shares how the investigations and explorations of the specific idea can be produced in design which helps me enhance a deeper understanding of the effects of each different method used in the design processes. 
            <br>
            Moreover, the way the project “Revealing Krishna: Journey to Cambodia’s Sacred Mountain” combines motion graphics, film, interactive media, and mixed reality stood out to me because it successfully creates a unique experience for the viewers by interacting with the sculpture both physically and digitally.

        <h2>Lecture 4</h2>
        <h3><span class="title">E Roon Kang and Andrew LeClair
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            During the lecture, E Roon Kang and Andrew LeClair present projects from their research initiative, 908A, which focuses on design practices aimed at shaping instructions. In this context, I had the opportunity to peruse various publications, including the physical catalog of the Communication Design exhibition and "1, 10, 100 Years of Form, Typography, and Interaction at Parsons" from the Parsons School of Design, which are specifically designed to showcase artwork and process demonstrations.
            <br>
            The publication, "1, 10, 100 Years of Form, Typography, and Interaction at Parsons," is notable for its unique relationship between the meaning of its title and the structure of the book. The book is divided into three distinct sections, each representing a different time period. The first section, "1," features student work from the past years, while the second section, "10," presents a retrospective of the last decade of the communication design curriculum. The third section, "100," symbolizes the broader history of the institution. Along with these contextual and structural aspects, the gradient on the front cover of the book serves as a visual element, providing an interesting tactile sensation for the reader. These design features of the publication promote interaction and engagement with the content, enhancing the reading experience for individuals such as myself.
