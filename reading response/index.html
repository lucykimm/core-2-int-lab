    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?
    </span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></h2>
    <time>Week 1</time>
    <p>
        Laurel Schwulst discusses the importance of individual online presence in creative design as the website is an individual act of common aspiration. The essay revolves around the idea of the necessity of personal websites for interaction among artists as she highlights the corporation of individuals for the potential web’s future and its vitality in a vast network. She explains the possibility and diversity in the forms of websites that are virtually limitless, and how the creator simultaneously takes on the role of author and architect. As creators apply visual elements to the website, it, in turn, contributes to the creation and development of their own identity. To that degree, the virtual space for personal ideas where people can experiment with new mediums and ways of making a digital landscape is more meaningful and crucial than the majority of websites designed for commercial purposes or business opportunities. Whether people choose to make that a personal project or something that’s accessible to the public, is a decision that comes later on in the process. 
        <br>
        I agree with how Schwulst defines world-building, which she associates inside the world with the surrounding world, such as language, style, rules, and architecture. Artists create their own work in their world for either themselves or others, which becomes an intersection with those people through sharing the virtual space. The significance of the website can be interconnected to how it works strategically in parallel to other activities of the artist. The use of metaphor in the essay is the most impressive aspect of the website. Schwulst compares a website to mundane objects and things, then explains how those objects are similar to websites. She uses metaphors for the form of individual websites by associating with naturalistic elements (a room, shelf, plant, etc.) She deliberately appeals to the artists to be more receptive to creating their own websites due to their positive aspects such as endless potential and uniqueness in various uses and ephemeral nature. For instance, she describes the “website as room” which induces audience, especially the artists by saying, “a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on the occasion.”

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">A Vernacular Web
    </span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>
    <time>Week 1</time>
    <p>
        In A Vernacular Web, Olia Lialina shares her perspective on web of the mid90’s and how web amateurs designed their websites with signs and symbols. I can see two different facets of the web of the mid90’s. Some web designers and users still consider those visual elements of pre-existing environments as powerful past and historical styles of web design, whereas some people no longer pursue outdated and old-fashioned behavior as the web has diversified and developed within progressive web designers with graphic skills. 
        <br>
        More specifically, mid90’s web is composed of eclectic, old, and retro style elements, such as “Under Construction Sign”, starry night background, free collections of signs and symbols, character encodings, MIDI, and frames. I think that the use of those visual, acoustic, and navigation elements on the mid90’s web reflects the early culture and the era when the Internet and virtual spaces were futuristic for people. The creation of webpages with mid90’s free graphics and various elements affected by the early culture can have their uniqueness in spirit and visual esthetic power. However, it is pivotal for web designers to clarify the purpose of applying mid90’s elements on their web and focus on the suitability of visual elements on the concept and context of the web. There may be some technical and visual changes needed for the elements created in mid90’s in order to create a more successive web accompanied by a cohesive design.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography: 1984-1997</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>
    <time>Week 2</time>
    <p>
        The article discusses a technical chronology of digital typography from 1984 to 1997 which the early technical advancements affected the innovations of graphic designs including typography and cyberspace. Throughout the reading, I could see that Staples underscores the importance of technology in design and its association with words and images in cyberspace through computer-modeled and algorithmically-driven typography. As the spatial opportunities of cyberspace increase with the development of digital tools, the formal and stylistic possibilities of expanding through depictions of letterforms. Indeed, digital tools are pivotal for designers who create words, images, and spaces on the screen or paper as Macintosh computers, and software like Adobe Systems chronologically contributed to the exploration and production of various experimental designs. From the technical chronology of digital typography, I found Macintosh Operating System intriguing in terms of the concentration on the text’s appearance. According to the article, “the system includes the ability to choose among multiple typefaces and font families that could be installed in the Macintosh system file.” Moreover, there are “standard options for rendering type as “plain text, bold, italic, underlined, outlined and shadowed in a range of sizes.” These settings show how people started to consider typographic designs in the earlier stage of the digital world and the significance of visual elements in words. Following the digital construction of letterforms, such as Lucida successfully satisfied the “multiple demands of page and screen through a comprehensive set of fonts suitable for printing and screen display.” Therefore, I realized that digital typography gradually becomes visually, conceptually, and purposefully powerful as the potential of diversity in typographic design extends with technological advancement.
