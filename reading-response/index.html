            <h3><span class="title">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst & A Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina</span></h3>
        <p>
        Laurel Schwulst discusses the importance of individual online presence in creative design as the website is an individual act of common aspiration. The essay revolves around the idea of the necessity of personal websites for interaction among artists as she highlights the corporation of individuals for the potential web’s future and its vitality in a vast network. She explains the possibility and diversity in the forms of websites that are virtually limitless, and how the creator simultaneously takes on the role of author and architect. As creators apply visual elements to the website, it, in turn, contributes to the creation and development of their own identity. To that degree, the virtual space for personal ideas where people can experiment with new mediums and ways of making a digital landscape is more meaningful and crucial than the majority of websites designed for commercial purposes or business opportunities. Whether people choose to make that a personal project or something that’s accessible to the public, is a decision that comes later on in the process. 
        <br>
        I agree with how Schwulst defines world-building, which she associates inside the world with the surrounding world, such as language, style, rules, and architecture. Artists create their own work in their world for either themselves or others, which becomes an intersection with those people through sharing the virtual space. The significance of the website can be interconnected to how it works strategically in parallel to other activities of the artist. The use of metaphor in the essay is the most impressive aspect of the website. Schwulst compares a website to mundane objects and things, then explains how those objects are similar to websites. She uses metaphors for the form of individual websites by associating with naturalistic elements (a room, shelf, plant, etc.) She deliberately appeals to the artists to be more receptive to creating their own websites due to their positive aspects such as endless potential and uniqueness in various uses and ephemeral nature. For instance, she describes the “website as room” which induces audience, especially the artists by saying, “a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on the occasion.” 
        </p>
    <p>
        In A Vernacular Web, Olia Lialina shares her perspective on web of the mid90’s and how web amateurs designed their websites with signs and symbols. I can see two different facets of the web of the mid90’s. Some web designers and users still consider those visual elements of pre-existing environments as powerful past and historical styles of web design, whereas some people no longer pursue outdated and old-fashioned behavior as the web has diversified and developed within progressive web designers with graphic skills. 
        <br>
        More specifically, mid90’s web is composed of eclectic, old, and retro style elements, such as “Under Construction Sign”, starry night background, free collections of signs and symbols, character encodings, MIDI, and frames. I think that the use of those visual, acoustic, and navigation elements on the mid90’s web reflects the early culture and the era when the Internet and virtual spaces were futuristic for people. The creation of webpages with mid90’s free graphics and various elements affected by the early culture can have their uniqueness in spirit and visual esthetic power. However, it is pivotal for web designers to clarify the purpose of applying mid90’s elements on their web and focus on the suitability of visual elements on the concept and context of the web. There may be some technical and visual changes needed for the elements created in mid90’s in order to create a more successive web accompanied by a cohesive design.

    <h3><span class="title">Typography and the Screen: A Technical Chronology of Digital Typography: 1984-1997</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h3>
    <p>
        The article discusses a technical chronology of digital typography from 1984 to 1997 which the early technical advancements affected the innovations of graphic designs including typography and cyberspace. Throughout the reading, I could see that Staples underscores the importance of technology in design and its association with words and images in cyberspace through computer-modeled and algorithmically-driven typography. As the spatial opportunities of cyberspace increase with the development of digital tools, the formal and stylistic possibilities of expanding through depictions of letterforms. Indeed, digital tools are pivotal for designers who create words, images, and spaces on the screen or paper as Macintosh computers, and software like Adobe Systems chronologically contributed to the exploration and production of various experimental designs. From the technical chronology of digital typography, I found Macintosh Operating System intriguing in terms of the concentration on the text’s appearance. According to the article, “the system includes the ability to choose among multiple typefaces and font families that could be installed in the Macintosh system file.” Moreover, there are “standard options for rendering type as “plain text, bold, italic, underlined, outlined and shadowed in a range of sizes.” These settings show how people started to consider typographic designs in the earlier stage of the digital world and the significance of visual elements in words. Following the digital construction of letterforms, such as Lucida successfully satisfied the “multiple demands of page and screen through a comprehensive set of fonts suitable for printing and screen display.” Therefore, I realized that digital typography gradually becomes visually, conceptually, and purposefully powerful as the potential of diversity in typographic design extends with technological advancement.

    <h3><span class="title">The Web’s Grain
    </span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h3>
    <p>
        The web is all about an “explicit act of will” - an individual’s choice to change their behaviors about what to use, where to work, what to adopt, and what to pay attention to. Frank Chimero who is a brand and product designer currently in New York shares his perspective on the design principles and visual elements of the web in regard to technological influences. I assume that one of the pivotal messages in the article which Chimero wants to convey is “no metaphors or analogies are needed for insight, only the willingness to listen to the subject speak for itself, even if it contradicts received wisdom.” This does not only apply to the design facets but also provides life lessons in various realms which underscore the importance of listening to others and embracing different points of view. 
        <br>
        In the article, Chimero discusses the “vertical bias” in web design which “vertical stacks are much easier to adapt across all kinds of screen sizes, because you don’t have layout issues to manage with more or less space across.” I could learn the visual effects of the web design method which accompanies the consistency of design. Indeed, the consistencies establish best practices as they are proof of design patterns. 
        <br>
        Furthermore, Chimero restated the web design as “an edgeless surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment.” The agelessness is comprised of “individual pages linked together, so its structure can branch out forever” in the web’s structure. Chimero highlights its crucial importance on the screens that show the web which “offers an infinite canvas that can scroll in any direction for however long” and “speaks to the diffusion of device and viewport sizes.” When I view the screens of the web that are naturally connected as they are single scenes, I can sense the blurred lines between the disciplines that work together to convey both visual and contextual information. The agelessness successfully and effectively designs the screens for the web with clarity of expression and communication. 
        <br>
        For me, it was easier to understand the idea of agelessness and structure of the web by depicting David Hokney’s project with Polaroids that are tiled together using redundancy in image-making practice. The way he abandoned the notion of two-dimensional works of art being fixed in rectangular size leads to the expression of small individual photos being overlaid and assembled which relates to the edgeless nature of web structure discussed in the article.

        <h3><span class="title">Black Gooey Universe
        </span> by <span class="author">American Artist
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            The article revolves around the idea of GUI, a Graphical User Interface, and how it affected technological development along with the whiteness of the screen in software. According to the author, Apple considered the GUI, mouse, and ethernet as the most valuable inventions. These devices were then popularized by approaching them into the Apple Lisa which is the first commercial computer to include GUI. I could learn the idea of whiteness by understanding of racial slavery and whiteness on the screen. Racial Slavery “provided the material and ideological basis” while whiteness in the space of high technology is “the core of the labs” and “inscribes all of the products borne out of it in a multitude of ways.” Overall, the strength of GUI in modern software, involving “a mouse and abstract screen display, which reduces literal movements of textual characters and bytes of data into icons with human-readable names.” was notable for me as this enhanced the understanding of the relationship between the screen and interfaces.

    <h3><span class="title">Statement: Function as narrative
    </span> by <span class="author">Weiyi Li
    </span></h3>
    <p>
        From the “Statement: Function as narrative”, Weiyi Li shows her strategy in conceptualizing and visualizing the idea of function and modifying her definition of the function. From the manufacturing perspective, the function is defined as “the projection of human needs on objects” and it is “the mission of any product” or “a prophecy: objects with function indicate a possibility of something to happen. function leads to a potential story, thus function is indeed a narrative.” All of these definitions are applicable in the design and production realm as well because the understanding of humans and objects is highly interconnected to function and design.
        <br>
        According to Li, she produced some works based on researching the idea of function. One of her pieces, a container for medicine reflects her perspective on the relationship between function and container. This stood out to me as she uses metaphor by saying “If an object narrates by its FUNCTION, a ‘container’ narrates by quoting other objects.” She points out the holiness and accuracy in the rite of taking pills which we get both physical and spiritual satisfaction when we take them from the designed container. 
        <br>
        In addition, I was impressed with her understanding of the reality in function and technology products that “Man-made products no longer function simply based on their physical appearance since we live in this era of Internet.” As we can see from the products of iPhone, the relationship between function and form is significant in the object.

        <h3><span class="title">Can the Internet be Archived?
        </span> by <span class="author">Jill Lepore
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            The article “Can the Internet be Archived?” by Jill Lepore discusses the web and the internet. From the article, I realized that web content has a finite duration, and posts have been known to disappear from the internet after as little as two hours. The Web is often cited as an example of eternal permanence; however, this is rarely accurate. 
            <br>
            Personally, David Cameron's assertions are interesting; with greater information comes greater power to hold those in positions of authority accountable. The shorter lifespan of online content should not be dismissed, however; accessibility and contextual relevance can both quickly fade too. Web pages are often thought to last forever, but the truth is that their life span is about a hundred days on average. 
            <br>
            In addition, the footnote is an essential part of the history of civilization, having taken centuries to develop and widely spread - yet it only took a few years for it to come close to destruction. A footnote provides evidence for a source or information: "Here's how I know this and where I found it". Sadly, in their current form, footnotes that include a link often lack accuracy; what was there once may no longer exist.

        </span> by <span class="author">Catherine D’lgnazio and Lauren Klein
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            In the article Data Feminism/Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach by Catherine D’lgnazio and Lauren Klein, I could learn the idea of data feminism which is a commitment to “challenging unequal power structures and working toward justice.” Data feminism is led by minoritized people and looks at multiple facets of inequality, such as race, gender, and class. According to the article, Klein states that the DGEI provides a model of the principle of data feminism which is to challenge power, and work towards equitable futures. 
            <br>
            I realized that, in order to challenge power, people need to examine that power by taking action against the unjust status quo. However, it is difficult to simply “engineer an unbiased system or a transparent algorithm” that pursues the justice and fairness of the data for a balanced future. Klein underscores the significance of understanding and designing the systems that address the source of the bias, which is structural oppression. The model in the article, “majoritized bodies are granted undeserved advantages and minoritized bodies must survive undeserved hardships.” stood out to me as it shows how the reality of data and oppression.

        <h3><span class="title">Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index
        </span> by <span class="author">Marie Hoejlund and Mindy Seu
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            The article “Sharing as Survival: Mindy Seu on the Cyberfeminism Index” by Marie Hoejlund and Mindy Seu, discusses cyberfeminism in terms of the relationship between women and technology. The author revolves around the idea of “digital hoarding, big-tech dystopias, future dreams of a slower web, and platforms that don’t ultimately commodify the people who use them.” The pivotal aspect of technology in relation to cyberfeminism is that the internet is a dynamic environment that is both shaped by and shapes its users. 
            <br>
            I was impressed with Seu’s perspective on Cyberfeminism which is more about the broader impact of technology on society, not limited to the examination of gender and technology. This shows the significance of understanding how technology affects and is affected by social, cultural, and political factors which challenge the traditional notions of cyberfeminism and offer a more inclusive definition of Cyberfeminism. The website projects related to Cyberfeminism introduced in the article, such as Korean scholar Heejung Son who uses “net femi” are interpreted as the choice to “list what Cyberfeminism was not, in a mix of different language” which is about the multiplicity.

        <h3><span class="title">The Adventures of an Avatar and Her Real Girl
        </span> by <span class="author">Helen Gregory
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            Helen Gregory discusses the idea of “Indigenous Futurism” in regard to the “Native slipstream” in the article “The Adventures of an Avatar and Her Real Girl”. “Indigenous Futurism” is described as an emerging trend involving utilizing science fiction and modern forms of communication to explore how conventional viewpoints of indigenous people can be imagined both presently and, more importantly, in the future. 
            <br>
            Skawennati criticizes the limited scope of indigenous people in a visual culture in which both real and imagined images of indigenous people are primarily historical and any contemporary depictions are restricted. The key is to understand that this imbalance can cause the misconception that “indigenous populations exist only in the past, but also promotes stereotypes of what indigenous people can or should be.” Moreover, envisioning indigenous people in the future and understanding how knowledge, histories, and traditions can be carried forward in meaningful ways is significant for indigenous people. 
            <br>
            The article mentions the idea that some individuals can develop such a strong relationship with their avatars that they do not distinguish themselves from their digital persona as Skawennati had a close relationship with her avatar, xox. The idea that individuals can form strong bonds with their avatars is fascinating and it raises questions about the relationship between humans and technology because it is interesting to consider how technology can impact our sense of self and how we define ourselves in relation to the digital world. 
            I was impressed with the author’s description of the    avatars which are like “naked and unembellished Barbies” that can be customized by their users. On the other hand, the changes made to an avatar’s physical appearance can have cultural implications beyond mere aesthetics and fashion choices. 
            <br>
            I could learn that the article highlights that xox is a reflection of Skawennati’s personal aspirations and her intention to envision a better world for indigenous people with greater agency to determine their future. 
            <br>
            In conclusion, the article offers an insightful perspective on the relationship between avatars and cultural context as it illustrates how avatars can be powerful tools for self-expression, personal reflection, and social change. It also highlights how the use of avatars can help to promote cultural diversity and create new possibilities for envisioning a better life.

        </span></h3>
        <p>
            In the article “Glitching the Master’s House: Legacy Russell and Momtaza Mehri in Conversation” Frieze magazine presents a conversation between two contemporary cultural critics, Legacy Russell and Momtaza Mehri. The article revolves around the book “Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto” which explores the intersection of technology, feminism, and race. 
            <br>
            Throughout the conversation, Russell and Mehri explore the concept of glitching as a disrupting and subverting the dominant power structure by discussing how glitching can be a tool for dismantling oppressive systems and creating space for marginalized voices and perspectives. I could learn the importance of recognizing the ways in which technology shapes our experiences and identities as I am a user of diverse technologies including the internet and media. People can easily recognize the impact of the use of technology in their lives as they create experiences and identities via both virtual and physical interaction with the technology. Russell’s argument on the creation of new possibilities for connection and empowerment through embracing the inherent glitches and errors in technology raises my question on the relationship between technology and potential in human experience. 
            <br>
            Overall, the conversation between Russell and Megri provides a significant exploration of the potential of glitching as a means of creating space for marginalized voices. Their discussion underscores the importance of considering the intersection of technology, race, and gender in our understanding of power and resistance.

            Disabled artists and activists, Bojana Coklyat and Finnegan Shannon introduce their collaborative project and share interactive webpage consisting of their book about the alt text, workshop of alt text as poetry, exhibition, tools including readings and resources, project called Ecosystem, and blog featuring alt text study club. 
            <br>
            I was impressed with the way both artists who have uniqueness approach their interest, the role of alt text as an essential part of web accessibility innovatively. They have their experience as disabled people and this leads to the deeper exploration of the nature of vision and integrates it with the alt text which “allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.” The idea of providing a sense of belonging in digital spaces for those disabled people by reframing alt text as a type of poetry successfully embraces the diversities and offers alternatives for some challenges in the use of digital spaces. In order to replace the vision in digital space, Bojana Coklyat and Finnegan Shannon use auditory support in their workbook consisting of a written introduction about alt text and alt text as poetry, but also a series of writing exercises. The website presents a curated collection of alt text poems which are organized thematically and accompanied by striking and often abstract images. Each poem offers a unique perspective on the image it describes, inviting readers to engage with the interplay between visual and textual representation which I found intriguing. 
            <br>
            Both artists provide a fascinating exploration of the intersection between accessibility, creativity, and technology which is a thought-provoking and inspiring project that demonstrates the power of innovative thinking to transform our understanding of the digital world.

        </span> by <span class="author">Joana Moll
        </span></h3>
        <p>
            The article “The Hidden Life of an Amazon User” is an account of the experience of purchasing a book from Amazon’s website and the hidden cost of energy that the user has to bear as part of Amazon’s business strategy. The author criticizes the “hidden” and aggressive exploitation of users by Amazon which highly rely on personalized user experiences and exploit the user’s free labor while forcing them to bear the energy cost of such exploitation. 
            <br>
            The article discusses the importance of recognizing the environmental impact of Amazon’s business model and how it affects the users’ shopping on the platform. More specifically, the convenience of Amazon’s business model accompanied by the attractive interfaces and algorithms to track users’ activity for monetization causes a cost to the environment due to its immense carbon footprint. 
            <br>
            The key is the users who shop on Amazon also bear some responsibility for this impact because of the reliance on fossil fuels for transportation and packaging required for purchase. To that degree, consumers need to be more aware of their purchasing decisions and the environmental impact they have. 
            <br>
            In addition, the author touches on the issue of labor rights, highlighting Amazon’s poor treatment of its workers who are often underpaid and overworked. This shows how the Amazon business model exploits both the environment and its employees which potentially leads to climate justice and labor rights issues. 
            <br>
            The article raises important questions about the ethics of internet companies’ business strategies and the hidden cost of energy that users are responsible for as part of their exploitation. 
            <br>
            Discussion Questions - In what ways does Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce market shape the broader economy and society?, How can we balance the convenience and accessibility of Amazon’s services with concerns around privacy, security, and sustainability?, What role can tech companies like Amazon play in addressing social and environmental issues, and how can they be held accountable for their impact on society?
